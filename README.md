# Aviation Accident Analysis

Suprisingly the data above shows that large airplane models have a more consistent safety profile. Large models also have lower average injury fractions overall. Small airplanes have greater variation in the serious/fatal injury fraction across different small aircraft makes. Plane size plays a major role large planes are generally safer on average. The indiviual make and models still matter significantly in both small and large categories.The safest aircraft are those with both low injury and destruction rates, and those are often concentrated among well-established manufacturers with strong safety records. 

I chose weather conditions and number of engines for my examples.

The engine type may be a proxy for aircraft size, complexity, or mission type, which affects accident severity. Aircraft with multiple engines may require additional safety measures and pilot support systems, especially in adverse conditions. The weather appears to have a huge effect on the safety of aircraft because the VMC (good visibility) measurement is significantly lower based on the chart above.
